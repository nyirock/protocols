“Headspace (0.1 mL) was removed anaerobically and injected into an Agilent 7890A GC 
equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and an Agilent J&W CP-PoraPLOT Q column. 
Carrier gas was 5% (v/v) methane 95% argon to enhance sensitivity of the ECD. 
Areas under the peak were compared to areas of 
standards with 0.1% (v/v), 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% nitrous oxide in the headspace”
