Here are a recipe for master mix and cycling conditions for 18S:
Reaction mixture with Pfu polymerase per 30ul reaction:
water 22.23ul
buffer 3ul 
dNTPs 0.2ul of a 25uM solution
forward primer 1.56ul of a 10uM solution
reverse primer 1.56ul of a 10uM solution
Pfu polymerase 0.25ul
template DNA 1ul


PCR conditions:
95C for 5 minutes,10 cycles of touchdown PCR: 95C for 30s, 60C for 30s (decreasing at 0.5C/cycle), and 72C for 30s, followed by 30 cycles: 95C for 30s, 55C for 30s, and 72C for 30s, and 72C for 5 minutes. 
Cheers,
Angela.
